### Changed:

- [Reorganizes asynchronous package structure](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)
    * The `jobs` package is renamed to `async` and split into the following subpackages:
        - `broadcastchannels` - Everything dealing with broadcast channels
        - `jobs` - Everything related to `jobs`, broken into subpackages
            * `jobrows` - Everything related to the content of the job metadata
            * `payloads` - Everything related to building the version of the job metadata to send to the user
            * `stores` - Everything related to the databases for job data
        - `preresponses` - Everything related to `PreResponses`, broken into subpackages
            * `stores` - Everything related to the the databases for PreResponse data
        - `workflows` - Everything related to the asynchronous workflow

-  [Removed timing component in JobsApiRequestSpec](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/27)
    * Rather than setting an async timeout, and then sleeping, 
      `JobsApiReqeustSpec::handleBroadcastChannelNotification returns an empty Observable if a timeout occurs before the notification is received`
      now verifies that the Observable returned terminates without sending any
      messages.

- [Preserve collection order of dimensions, dimension fields and metrics](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/25)
    * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensions` now returns a `LinkedHashSet`
    * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>`
    * `DataApiRequest::withPerDimensionFields` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` as its second argument.
    * `DataApiRequest::getDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
    * `Response::Response` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>` as
      its second  and third arguments.
    * `ResponseContext::dimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now takes a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
    * `ResponseContext::getDimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`

-  [Fix Dimension Serialization Problem with Nested Queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/15)
    * Modified `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec` serializer to serialize dimension to apiName if it is not the inner most query
    * Added helper `hasInnerQuery` to `Util` in serializer package to determine if current query is the inner most query or not
    * Added tests for `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec`
